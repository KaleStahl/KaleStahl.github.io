# Kale Stahl
### Email: stahl37[at]purdue.edu

Hi all! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Kale Stahl, and I am currently in my final year of my undergraduate studies in mathematics and physics at Kansas State University. This fall, I will be attending Purdue to pursue my Ph.D. in mathematics. My research interests lie in inverse problems and applied analysis, especially inverse scattering problems and scattering theory.

At K-State I have worked with [Dr. Dinh-Liem Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/dinhliemnguyen/home) and [Dr. Trung Truong](https://mupages.marshall.edu/sites/truongt/) on multiple projects involving shape reconstruction in inverse scattering problems. I have worked previously with [Dr. Yulia Hristova](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~yuliagh/) and [Dr. Aditya Viswanathan](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~adityavv/) in the 2022 University of Michigan-Dearborn REU For Analysis and Application on a project detecting edge signals from phaseless signal measurements.
