Hi all, Kale here! Welcome to my webpage. I am currently a second year Mathematics PhD student at Purdue University. I completed my undergraduate schooling in Math and Physics at Kansas State University. I am a 2024 recipient of the NSF GRFP.

My research interests lie in inverse scattering theory and numerical solutions to inverse scattering problems. At the moment I have been working on projects with numerical solutions to the Biharmonic scattering problem with approximate far-field data using a MUSIC algorithm.

At K-State I worked with [Dr. Dinh-Liem Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/dinhliemnguyen/home) and [Dr. Trung Truong](https://mupages.marshall.edu/sites/truongt/) on projects involving shape reconstruction in acoustic inverse scattering problems. I have worked previously with [Dr. Yulia Hristova](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~yuliagh/) and [Dr. Aditya Viswanathan](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~adityavv/) in the 2022 University of Michigan-Dearborn REU For Analysis and Application on a project detecting edge signals from phaseless signal measurements.
