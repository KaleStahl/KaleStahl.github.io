Hi all, Kale here! Welcome to my webpage. I am currently a second year Mathematics PhD student at Purdue University. I am a 2024 recipient of the NSF GRFP.

My research interests lie in inverse scattering theory and numerical solutions to inverse scattering problems. I have worked mostly on shape reconstruction using sampling methods, but have ventured into scattering theory proper at times.
