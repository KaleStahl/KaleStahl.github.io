# Monster Hunter Wilds

First Played: 2/28/2025<br>
Play Time so Far: 24 hours<br>
Overall Review Score: 4/7<br>

This section may turn into a rant, but it's whatever. I was so incredibly excited for this game. I first played Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii with my friend in 3rd grade, and was immediately hooked. I've played 200 hours of MH3U, at least 700 hours of MH4U, 600 hours of MHG+MHGU, and like 400 hours of MHRise. I adore Monster Hunter Stories and Stories 2, and even went back and bought a PSP to bang my head against a wall in Freedom Unite. It's safe to say I'm a pretty big fan of the Monster Hunter series.
Despite this, you might notice that I've played almost all Monster Hunter releases except for Monster Hunter World and Iceborne. This is because I am a filthy casual who only owned a 3DS and a Switch at the time, and didn't think it was worth it to buy a nice PC or console to play World. (I was also like 17 and didn't have much disposable income to drop on such things) 

This all changed with Monster Hunter Wilds. I had gotten my partner into Rise with me, so we were both excited to play a new game together. The Switch made it super easy for us to play together in the same house: one of us would play on the TV, the other in handheld mode. Wilds, however, was not releasing (nor should it ever release) on the Switch. My partner already had a decent PC, so she could play, but without my own setup I was out of luck.
