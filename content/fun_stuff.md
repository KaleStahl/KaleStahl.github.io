## [Spreadsheets]({{< ref "/spreadsheets.md" >}})

Here you'll find a bunch of spreadsheets and spreasheet templates for various things: video games, tests, physics labs, Pokemon Cards, and so much more. 

## [Code Snippets that Aren't Cool Enough for Github]({{< ref "/code_snippets.md" >}})

For things that don't work well as spreadsheets, I make poorlyncoded python applications to serve their purpose. Here you'll find code that isn't good enough to be on my [Github profile](https://github.com/KaleStahl), primarily for my own archival reasons.

## [Incoherent Ramblings]({{< ref "/ramblings.md" >}})
Here you'll find some documents of my unfinished work, which could be math, or something else. But knowing me, it's probably math.


## [Photo Gallery (primarily of my dog)]({{< ref "/gallery.md" >}})
Here are a bunch of photos also for archival reasons. You'll find the vast majority are of my dog.
