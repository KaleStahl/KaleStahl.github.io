I am currently supported with funding as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

My current research involves numerical methods for shape reconstruction in inverse scattering problems. In an inverse scattering problem, waves are scattered from an object, and the incident and resulting wave are measured, with no a priori information about the scattering object. It is the goal of my work to use the information about the incident and scattered wave to determine characteristics about the unknown object. Inverse scattering problems and ill-posed and non-linear, which poses an issue when looking to establish these methods in practical applications.
