I am currently supported with funding as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

In general, I am interested in PDE and their applications to physics. I don't have an official advisor at the moment, but I have been working on some introductory problems with [Dr. Isaac Harric](https://sites.google.com/site/isaacpurduemath/) the past few semesters. At the moment I have been working on projects with numerical solutions to the Biharmonic scattering problem with approximate far-field data using a MUSIC algorithm and the Born approximation.

At K-State I worked with [Dr. Dinh-Liem Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/dinhliemnguyen/home) and [Dr. Trung Truong](https://mupages.marshall.edu/sites/truongt/) on projects involving shape reconstruction in acoustic inverse scattering problems. I have worked previously with [Dr. Yulia Hristova](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~yuliagh/) and [Dr. Aditya Viswanathan](https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~adityavv/) in the 2022 University of Michigan-Dearborn REU For Analysis and Application on a project detecting edge signals from phaseless signal measurements.
