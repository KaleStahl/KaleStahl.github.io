I am originally from Topeka, KS and am currently a senior finishing my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. I will be pursuing my Ph.D. in mathematics at Purdue University this fall. After my Ph.D., my goal is to be a professor at a university and teach and conduct research full time.

My current research interests lie within applied anlaysis and PDE, and I am particularly fond of mathematical application to physics, especially within wave equations. I did most of my undergraduate work on Inverse Scattering problems and their numerical solutions, and I hope to continue to explore this during my Ph.D.

Outside of math, I am just generally a nerd. I enjoy making spreadsheets for fun (you will find many of the more interesting ones on this website). I enjoy of Nintendo games from all eras. I own every Nintendo console except for a SNES and I love to play Mario Party and Mario Kart with my friends and girlfriend. I also have a 2 year old beagle mix (with what, I have no idea) named Boo who is quite the handful. He could have an entire page dedicated to his goofy self on this site, but he would never be able to read it.

As if all of the above wasn't enough, I also play the Pokemon Trading Card game competitively. I started play competitively a few years ago, and since then have attended numerous large regional and national championships, with my best finish being 164th at the 2023 San Antonio Regionals with my beloved [SableZard deck](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/9576). Indiana is much closer to more regionals than Kansas, so I hope to be able to compete more during my time in graduate school!
