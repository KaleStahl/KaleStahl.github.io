I am originally from Topeka, KS and I completed my undergrad in Mathematics and Physics at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. I came to Purdue because their Math department is one of the few in the country that actually has a research group for Scattering Theory! After my PhD, my goal is to be a professor at a university and teach and conduct research full time.

My current research interests lie within applied anlaysis and PDE, and I am particularly fond of mathematical application to physics, especially within wave equations. I did most of my undergraduate work on Inverse Scattering problems and their numerical solutions.

Outside of math, I am just generally a nerd. I enjoy making spreadsheets for fun (you will find many of the more interesting ones on this website). I enjoy of Nintendo games from all eras. I own every Nintendo console except for a SNES and I love to play Mario Party and Mario Kart with my friends and girlfriend. I also have a 3 year old german shepard and coonhound mix named Boo who is... let's just say "special". He could have an entire page dedicated to him on this site, but he would never be able to read it.

As if all of the above wasn't enough, I also play the Pokemon Trading Card game competitively. I started play competitively a few years ago, and since then have attended numerous large regional and national championships, with my best finish being 164th at the 2023 San Antonio Regionals with my beloved [SableZard deck](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/9576).
