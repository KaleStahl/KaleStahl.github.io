I am originally from Topeka, KS and am currently a senior finishing my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. I will be pursuing my Ph.D. in mathematics at Purdue University this fall. After my Ph.D., my ultimate goal is to be a professor at a university and teach and conduct research full time.

My current research interests and in applied math and PDE, and I am particularly fond of mathematical application to physics, especially within wave equations. I did most of my undergraduate work on Inverse Scattering problems and their numerical solutions, and I hope to continue to explore this during my Ph.D.

Outside of math, I am just generally a nerd. I enjoy making spreadsheets for fun (you will find many of the more interesting ones on this website). I am also quite fond of Nintendo games from all eras. I own every Nintendo console except for a SNES and I love to play Mario Party and Mario Kart with my friends and girlfriend.

In addition to this, I also play the Pokemon Trading Card game competitively. I started play competitively in March 2023, and since then have attended a few regional championships, with my best finish being 164th at the 2023 San Antonio Regionals with my beloved SableZard deck.
