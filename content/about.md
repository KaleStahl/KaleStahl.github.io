I am originally from Topeka, KS and I completed my undergrad in Mathematics and Physics at Kansas State University. I came to Purdue because their Math department is one of the few in the country that actually has a research group for Scattering Theory. After my PhD, my goal is to stay in academia and teach and conduct research full time. Given the current climate and job market I am flexible in that goal however...

My current research interests lie within applied anlaysis and PDE, and I am particularly fond of mathematical application to physics, especially within wave equations. I did most of my undergraduate work on Inverse Scattering problems and their numerical solutions. I have ventured into more modern "mathematical physics" but the sheer amount of representation theory and Lie algebras have made me lean closer to applied analysis. I am still interested in the PDE that arise from general relativity, but there isn't much math that can be done there at the moment that I either feel strongly towards doing or have the mental capacity to learn. 

Outside of math, I have too many hobbies. I enjoy woodworking, playing video games, playing card games, coding, sculpting, cooking, and whatever else I decide I want to do that day. I have made a [separate page](/category/) for ramblings related to these things.

I have a 3 year old german shepard and coonhound mix named Boo who is... let's just say "special". We also recently adopt a cat name Celery! She is an absolute crackhead and loves to get up to trouble with her brother.

I also play the Pokemon Trading Card game competitively! I started play competitively a few years ago, and since then have attended numerous large regional and national championships, with my best finish being at the 2023 San Antonio Regionals with my beloved [SableZard deck](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/9576). The Pokemon TCG is also awesome because of the sheer amount of retro formats I can build and play! I currently have 71 retro decks built from formats spanning 2004 all the way to 2019, and I can't stop building more!
