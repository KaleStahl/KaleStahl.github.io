<h1 id="an-introduction-to-sum-lot">An Introduction to SUM-LOT</h1>
<p>The Sun and Moon era of the Pokemon TCG is looked back on extremely fondly by competitively players, and rightly so. After the dominance of big-basic strategies in the Black and White era, and them continuing into XY due to the lackluster Mega Evolution mechanic, it was exciting to see the evolving Pokemon GX take over the reigns. With the introduction of the first few Sun and Moon sets, many of the less than desirable attributes of the XY era persisted: an over reliance on &ldquo;turbo&rdquo; item cards, basic pokemon dominating the format, and supporters that were extremely powerful with no negative impact on deck consistency. Almost every deck ran 4 Trainers&rsquo; mail, VS Seeker and Puzzle of Time, with hopes of setting up faster than their opponent. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough, the format included Professor Sycamore for draw support, N for late game disruption and even more early draw support, and Lysandre for unconditional gusting, all with unparalleled ease of access with VS seeker.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src = "/Sun-Moon-Promo-Art.png" width="1000" class="center" />
  </p>
<p>The 2017 and 2018 seasons went on with most of these cards legal, but the new, slower game-design brought on with Pokemon GX was beginning to shine through. It wasn&rsquo;t until all of the XY cards rotated out, do I think the format really got REALLY good. Unfortunately, this format only lasted until Team Up, when Pokemon decided to go back on everything that made Sun and Moon good and introduce insanely powerful basic 3-prize Tag Teams which took the format right back into the grips of turbo big basics. For this short time in 2018, from Sun and Moon base to Lost Thunder, we had one of the most fun and least toxic formats the TCG has seen in its modern era.
When I say that this format is not &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; I mean the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: There is no Tier 0 Deck, that is, a deck that is so much better than anything else you either play it or hard counter it.</li>
<li>2: There are multiple Tier 1 Decks, meaning there are options when it comes to picking a viable deck</li>
<li>3: Few decks lose to a single card tech inclusion, such as an immunity ability or stadium that hard-counters an entire strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avid SUM-LOT players may conclude that point 1 is false in this format. They would be mostly correct, but I argue it won&rsquo;t matter if you are playing casually. When you aren&rsquo;t playing in organized tournaments, you make the rules! If you don&rsquo;t like playing against control or walls, just don&rsquo;t build it! This allows you to have a curated metagame where you only play the fun matchups. If your favorite deck has an autoloss, you can just not play that matchup, or put in techs just for that game and take them out otherwise. Of course, this does mean if you attend organized tournaments with prizing on the line you might have to play your hated decks, but that&rsquo;s what the prizing is for! Nothing good comes easy, and Pokemon is no different!</p>
<p>For the most part, this format has many decks that are fun, consistent, and have a decent matchup spread, making it a great format to build some decks and play with your friends. At the time I built these decks (Summer 2023) they were quite affordable (~$40 a deck) to get everything in the correct printing and in decent condition, making SUM-LOT an even better choice for players just starting their venture into retro formats. The format is also quite skill expressive, with many control-type decks running around, players can easily be &ldquo;skill-diffed&rdquo; even in losing matchups.</p>
<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>
<p>The basic rules of the Pokemon TCG have stayed largely the same since its inception, but certain rules or mechanics have been tweaked throughout the years. Below are some of the bigger changes from modern-day (2025) standard format:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player going first can use items, stadiums, tools, attach energy, AND use supporters on their first turn. They may not attack.</li>
<li>Pokemon Tool cards are considered item cards.</li>
<li>Pokemon GX give up 2 prizes when knocked out and follow normal evolution rules.</li>
<li>Each Pokemon GX possesses a GX move. When one of these moves are used that player flips their GX marker and cannot use another GX move in this game.</li>
<li>Prism Star Cards are limited to one per name in your deck, i.e. you can have one Ditto Prism Star and one Cyrus Prism Star, but not two of either. When they would be discarded, they are instead sent to the lost zone. This makes them impossible to recycle.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="important-cards">Important Cards</h1>
<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll detail some of the most important and influential cards that appear in SUM-LOT. This format is extremely diverse, so these are just the heavy hitters. I encourage you to look at other resources and see what other cards could be good in any deck you&rsquo;re building! Just because someone else didn&rsquo;t play it doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t make the deck better. Even though their time in the spotlight is over, retro formats are constantly evolving and SUM-LOT is no different.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="supporters">Supporters</h2>
<div>
<p>
Unlike modern formats, supporters were still able to be played on the first turn for the player going first. This allows for many more setup options for both players. Lysandre, N, and Professor Sycamore just rotated, so players were scrambling to find supporters to fill the void these three powerhouses left. 
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/guzma.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Guzma - BUS" 
style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
Fortunately, (or unfortunately for some), Burning Shadows replaced the unconditional gust of Lysandre with another gusting effect, Guzma. Guzma allows you to gust an opponent&rsquo;s benched Pokemon, and if you do, you must switch your own active Pokemon to the bench.This may be an even better effect than Lysandre, one of the best cards ever. Not only is gusting absolutely vital to the Pokemon TCG to ensure win conditions and punish opponents for benching vulnerable support Pokemon, but also serving as a switch card gives Guzma even more utility than Lysandre. Did you start your 3 retreat tech attacker? No problem! Just Guzma up a weak benched Pokemon and both take a prize card and get a liability out of the active! Guzma allows for extra creativity in deck building, as it can surve multiple purposes, allowing players to cut switch cards for more consistency.
<br></p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/lillie.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Lillie - SUMO" 
style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
When Guzma released, it almost universally replaced Lysandre. This was not the case for the draw supporters Lillie and Professor Sycamore. Though Lillie was released many sets after Professor Sycamore, it didn&rsquo;t see any play until we lost our Kalosian professor. Lillie allows you to draw cards until you have 6 in hand, which by itself is a fine effect seen on cards like Bianca before. However, it is the second line of text that really lets Lillie shine. If it is a players first turn, that player can draw cards until they have 8 in hand! Thats a lot of cards, especially for the first turn. Since Lillie spikes in usefulness on the first turn, many decks either play it as a 1-of to search with Tapu Lele GX or 4-of to maximize the chances of getting it in your opening hand. Either way, Lillie serves as an explosive early setup card, and a decent draw card in the mid to late game.
<br></p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/cynthia.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Cynthia - UPR" 
style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
Lillie relies on being able to play your hand down in order to draw cards, but what if your deck has a lot of evolutions or supporters and some hands become impossible to play down enough for Lillie to be effective? Enter Cynthia, the quintessential draw supporter. Shuffle draw 6 is pretty good, and being able to play Cynthia to see more cards without playing your hand down can be vital for slower setup decks that don&rsquo;t play many items or basic pokemon they can easily pitch from their hand.
<br></p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/elm.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Professor Elm's Lecture - LOT" 
style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
Cynthia and Lillie are good for seeing more cards, but sometimes you know exactly what you want and don&rsquo;t want to deal with whatever faff they may draw. This is where Professor Elm&rsquo;s lecture sees play. Decks that play a lot of basic GX&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t able to utilize it well, but evolving decks love the ability to search out 3 of their evolving basics. Elm also allows for some interesting choices to be made in deckbuilding. Would you like to use the 60 HP version of basic pokemon to search them with Elm, or would you prefer the 70 HP version that may have better attacks? This interplay is what makes Elm an interesting card in this format, as not all decks use it, but that ones that do REALLY depend on it to find their little guys.
<br></p>
<p>There are more niche supporters that see quite a bit of play, such as Professor Kukui to boost damage by 20, Acerola to pick up and heal damaged Pokemon, or Apricorn Maker for decks that play a lot of Poke Ball cards. These are the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; ones, but as I said before, don&rsquo;t be afraid to try out of the box supporters! Especially with Tapu Lele GX, one-of supporters can be found very easily and can help shift the tide of the battle in your favor!</p>

<h2 id="item-cards">Item Cards</h2>
<div>
Unlike other formats, items are not at the forefront of SUM-LOT, which in my opinion is good! Fewer must-play items generally allows for a slower, more methodical pace to games. In my time playing this format, rarely am I playing more than two or three item cards a turn and my entire setup isn't stunted if I miss a few key combos turn one (*cough* worlds 2016 *cough*). 
<p>That being said, ball search is still at a premium. We have the likes of ultra ball, nest ball, and great ball in format for general Pokemon search. Most decks will play some combination of these three, but there are a few more niche ball search options if your deck calls for it. Timer ball allows for evolution decks to find evolutions without the hefty cost of discarding 2 cards from their hand, although for the slightly more annoying downside of being reliant on coin flips. Mysterious Treasure is an amazing universal search card for decks that play many dragon or psychic Pokemon.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/ultra.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Ultra Ball- SUMO" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/nest.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Nest Ball - SUMO" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/great.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Great Ball - SUMO" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/rescue-stretcher.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Rescue Stretcher - GRI" 
style="float: right;margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
<p>Not every format has decent Pokemon recovery. Usually, there is some rod-type item that shuffles Pokemon or energy from the discard to the deck, or some card that takes a pokemon directly from the discard to the hand. SUM-LOT is amazing, because it has a card that can do both! Rescue stretcher can either shuffle three Pokemon from the discard back into the deck, or take any one and return it directly to your hand. This card is (as of now) the most powerful item-based recovery card in history. The option to either shuffle multiple Pokemon or immediately get one back lends itself to be helpful in almost any situations, and allows for further role compression like Guzma mentioned before.</p>
</p>
Pokemon Tools are a vital part of any metagame, and while this remains true for SUM-LOT, it tends to lack the options seen in other formats. Choice band is essential for any deck that needs to buff its numbers on Pokemon GX, and counter gain is useful for decks that both like to fall behind and have attacks with colorless energy to use it. Aside from that, there are just a few other niche tools that a couple decks might want to use.
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/choice-band.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Choice Band - GRI"
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/counter-gain.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Counter Gain - BUS" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
    <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/field-blower.png" 
      width="200" class="center" 
      alt = "Field Blower - GRI" 
      style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
</p>
Despite not having a variety of tools and as we'll later see, stadiums, Guardians Rising gave us Field Blower. This simple leaf blower is a super buffed tool scrapper that can now discard stadiums. Since stadiums and tools aren't absolutely necessary as with older formats, this card finds itself as a one-of in most decks rather than a four-of when we had Garbotoxin. Even though its population has dwindled, when used at the right time its power is still undeniable.
</div>

<h2 id="stadiums">Stadiums</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/brooklet-hill.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Brooklet Hill - GRI" 
    style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"/>
    As I said previously, stadiums are more of a niche inclusion in this format, but there are still two big ones that I feel are worth mentioning. Brooklet Hill is an absolutely insane stadium, allowing either player to search their deck for any water or fighting Pokemon, with or without a rule box. With fighting and water Pokemon such as baby Buzzwole, Lycanroc GX, and Alolan Vulpix being as splashable as they are, Brooklet hill becomes an easy inclusion in many decks. Even if you don't play it in your deck, often you can steal your opponent's Brooklet hill!
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/shrine-punish.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Shrine of Punishment - CES" 
style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" />
The only &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; stadium in this format is played by single prize decks to help fix math on GX-heavy decks. Shrine of Punishment puts 1 damage counter on all GX Pokemon in-between turns, which can really stack up! Decks like White-Kyurem and Granbull will play heavy counts of Shrine to punish the general lack of Field Blower and other counter stadiums. Occasionally you will see other archetype specific stadiums such as Devoured Field in Zoroark GX or Temple of the Moone in Malamar decks, but Shrine and Brooklet hill and the most popular and something you should always be on the lookout for.</p>
  </p>

<h2 id="pokemon">Pokemon</h2>
<div>
Trainers are fun, but Pokemon are (literally) the name of the game. Pokemon GX are Sun and Moon's new mechanic, and boy are they good. They give up two prizes when knocked out like Pokemon EX before them, but as I mentioned previously, they follow the normal evolution rules. Rowlet evolves into Dartrix, which then can evolve into Decidueye GX. This small change is massive since the evolving Pokemon are so much stronger than their basic counterparts, so-called "big basic" strategies are phased out in favor of evolving Pokemon GX. The GX mechanic also tries to parallel the video games' Z-moves with each Pokemon GX having a special GX attack. These moves are extremely powerful, and once you use one you must flip a marker and are unable to use a GX attack for the rest of the game. These once-per game attacks, while not game breaking, are an interesting change of pace and allow for long term decision making not only on when to use your GX attack, but which one to use since all Pokemon GX possess one.
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/zoroark-gx.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Zoroark GX - SHF" 
style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"/>
If you ask any competitive player who played between 2017 and 2019 what they think is the strongest card ever printed, most if not all would say Zoroark GX. This card has everything, an amazing draw ability, an efficient attack, colorless energy cost, and a massive 210 HP. Zoroark is so versatile, it can be paired with almost anything. Since it provides a low to the ground draw engine and can fulfill its entire attack cost for only a Double Colorless Energy, it is a welcome addition to any evolving decks that need an engine and plays DCE. Common partners include (but are not limited to!): Lycanroc GX, Glaceon GX, Oranguru, Ninetales GX, Decidueye GX, Gyarados, Weavile, or even itself! Pure Zoroark decks are just as viable as partnering it with another attacker.</p>
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/oranguru-up.png" 
width="200" 
class="center" 
alt = "Oranguru - UPR" 
style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" />
The most egregious partner for Zoroark GX might be Oranguru from Ultra Prism. Remember when I said there is a tier zero deck in this format? It&rsquo;s control, and Oranguru is a massive contrbutor to that. Oranguru allows you to return any three cards from your discard to the bottom of your deck. Paired with Zoroark, you can easily draw through you deck each turn and recover disruption items such as Crushing and Enhanced Hammer, Counter Catcher, and Max Potion to run your opponent out of resources. This gives you a near infinite loop and even some non-control decks will run Oranguru to help recycle importamt resources like Double Colorless Energy or Rare Candy. This is one of the most powerful attacks in the history of the game, and it being banned from Expanded and Gym Leader Challenge should show its ability to create toxic games. I will talk more about control in the next section, but do not worry! Even though I said Oranguru can be toxic, I think there are ways to mitigate it when playing this format for fun.</p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/tapu-lele-gx.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Tapu Lele GX - GRI" 
style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"/>
Zoroark GX is able to give decks a solid draw engine on a stage 1, but what if you don&rsquo;t have time for all this evolving nonsense? Tapu Lele GX may be the card for your deck! Wonder Tag lets you search any supporter when you bench Tapu Lele, meaning an Ultra Ball or Mysterious Treasure can become any supporter you want. Not only in Tapu Lele an excellent support Pokemon, it is rarely a liability once you bench it. With only one retreat and 170 HP, it is difficult for your opponent to use Guzma to either knock it out or trap it in the active. Energy drive is also a great attack, dealing 20 damage for every energy attached to both active for only a Double Colorless energy which allows Tapu Lele to attack in a pinch. Almost every deck plays at least one Tapu Lele GX, if not more as the consistency it provides is absolutely invaluable.</p>
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/marshadow.png" 
width="200" 
class="center" 
alt = "Marshadow - SHF" 
style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" />
Unlike other formats with Marnie, N, Iono, or Rocket&rsquo;s Admin, the only real supporter based hand disruption present in SUM-LOT is Judge. For the record, Judge is absolutely not bad, it just is not usualy your first choice for your single supporter for turn. But what if judge was usable as an ability? Enter Marshadow&rsquo;s Let Loose. First seen on Giratina from Platinum, this ability essentials lets you play judge whenever you bench it from hand. Since it doesn&rsquo;t take your supporter slot, you can either Let Loose in hopes of finding a supporter, or use a supporter to find your Marshadow. Some think that the ability to play both a turn 1 supporter and Let Loose could be toxic; forcing your opponent to start with a 4 card hand before they even get to do anything. I am not of this camp. The abundant Pokemon and supproter search with Tapu Lele GX makes an early Let Loose not nearly as effective as late game once you know what resources your opponent has left. While some players may try to brick their opponent off an early Let Loose, I&rsquo;ve found that it rarely wins games outright, if doing anything at all.</p>
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/dittoprism.png" 
width="200" 
class="center" 
alt = "Ditto Prism Star - LOT" 
style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;" />
Ditto Prism Star might be my absolute favorite card ever printed. Its ability lets you put any stage 1 onto it to evolve it as if it were the proper basic, with no other cost! This can act as a fifth basic in decks that really rely on getting their evolutions going, or a cheeky way to play tech evolution cards. Many decks would play Alolan Muk or Magcargo and not even run the basic Alolan Grimer or Slugma, just Ditto Prism Star! The best part? If you are playing a matchup where you don&rsquo;t need to set up your tech card, Ditto can be any other basic! It allows for niche strategies without hindering your consistency. This card is an absolute staple in any deck that plays stage 1s, and I love the versatility and strategy it brings to the game.</p>
<p>These are a few of the cards you should definitely consider when building decks for this format &ndash; either playing them or finding ways to couter them. This format is quite wide and has many viable strategies, so just because Zoroark is good, doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone will play it!</p>

<h1 id="metagame">Metagame</h1>
<p>Since this format is no longer being played competively (at least officially), the only hard data we have to go off is from 2018 when it was played. Luckily, the amazing <a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/tournaments?time=all&amp;type=all&amp;format=SUM-LOT&amp;region=all">Limitless.tcg</a> has a lot of data on most of the major tournaments that happened at the time, so I can do some data analysis on that. Table 1 is created by me compiling all of the available data from Limitless, and then filtering based on more general archetypes than Limitless does. The meta percentages do not add up to 100%, and that is because certain decks qualify for multiple archetypes, so decks like Zoroark-Glaceon count as both a Zoroark deck and a Glaceon deck. Limitless data is usually limited to only Day 2 qualifiers or Top 8 in smaller tournaments, so this is not a perfect representation of the metagame at the time, but I feel like it can give you a gist of what the top decks were in the meta at any given time.</p>

<p>The thing that sticks out immediately is the absolute dominance of Zoroark in terms of meta representation.

    *Table 2 - Zoroark Archetypes*
  </p>
<p>Though each of the Zoroark decks are distinct enough that I would not consider them one deck, they all have very similar strategies (minus control, I&rsquo;ll talk about that in a second). Zoroark serves as a draw engine and early game attacker, and then the partner is either additional support in the case of Ninetales or Decidueye, or a strong late game attacker that can efficiently utilize a single attachment or DCE, like Lycanroc or Weavile. Zoroark allows for these decks to also function as pure Zoroark decks if the partner is not useful for a certain matchups, so there is rarely a reason to not run a partner since Zoroark is so strong on its own.</p>
<p>Now to address the orangutan in the room. Control is really good. Like REALLY good. Depending on the expected metagame, control can either be energy disruption loops with Oranguru, tank and heal with Regigigas or Steelix, special energy or low energy walling with Xurxitree GX or Shuckle GX, retreat locking with Guzma/Counter Catcher and Rockruff, or even mill with Rhyperior. It can really be whatever you want. Are people teched for Zoroark control with shrines and fighting types? Run Swampert control instead! One of my decks below is called &ldquo;kitchen sink control&rdquo; because it is exactly that, everything and the kitchen sink for any metagame! In Table 3 is the breakdown of control archetypes I&rsquo;ve found.</p>

    *Table 3 - Control Archetypes*
  </p>
<p>Control is not only strong becasue of its versatility, but also its numerous loops and win conditions. The standard loop is to use the absolutely broken Resource Management with Oranguru to infinite recycle stuff like Max Potion, Enhanced or Crushing Hammer, and Counter Catcher. If a deck doesn&rsquo;t play many energy or recovery, energy denial with hammers or Plumeria is a great start. If they have a capped amount of damage, tanking and healing with Acerola and Max potion work. These are great if your opponent is trying to win by taking prizes, but are worthless against other control decks. No reason to worry! Stall decks have Unown HAND, which allows them to win the game if they have 35 or more cards in hand, which sounds difficult, but is rather simple with looping Lusamine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listed all the ways control is so good, but it has to have some weaknesses, right? As is common with controlling strategies, control decks in SUM-LOT need a lot of setup. Either setting up your draw engine, getting your walls into play at the right time, getting your healing cards at the right time, or just having cards to play can all take a few turns, which your opponent can and should take advantage of. Aggressive decks can often run control off the board before they can even set up. Buzzwole archetypes are great at this, and any deck that carries hand disruption like Marshadow or Judge can make the control player start their whole setup all over! When playing against control, you need to map out when you attach your energy and when not to, as Plumeria can discard energy from the board and Team Skull Grunt can discard energy from your hand. Switches are also an important resource, as if the control player traps something in the active that takes multiple attachments to retreat, they can discard your energy as you put it on and keep you stuck.</p>
<p>Sometimes no matter how well you play, your deck just loses to control. While not ideal, there are a few 1 card solutions that can help in the matchup. Girafarig from Lost Thunder and its Get Lost attack are great for Oranguru decks, as it is able to lost zone important resources they were hoping to recover with resource management. If your deck is stuck on Hoopa, there are many single prize options that can slot into decks either with the energy or evolving from Ditto Prism. You should always make sure you have some strategy to beat a lone Hoopa.</p>

<p>The following decks are my current collection of decks for this format. They may not be the best or most competitively viable, but they are what I have built after playing the format for a few years casually. All of the photos are taken by me, and I have put decklist credit when applicable. I have also discussed the basic strategies of the decks and what certain inclusions do so people who are just picking up the format can have a nice place to start! My most common question from my friends when playing retro is &ldquo;What the heck is this card in here for?&rdquo;, so I hope that these little blurbs can explain why the decks look like that! Below these are also a written decklist and a Limitless import for each deck if you would like to copy the decklist as text.</p>

<p>This deck tries to leverage the amount of GX Pokemon in format by abusing Shrine of Punishment with strong and efficient single prize attackers. Baby Buzzwole is your main attacker, as sledgehammer can be boosted with Beast Energy, Diancie Prism, or Choice Band to immediately start throwing damage on your opponents board. Since there are no multi-prizers in this deck, your opponent is (usually) forced to go down to exactly 4 prize cards at some point, giving Buzzwole an even stronger sledgehammer for a big swing turn. Garbodor&rsquo;s Trashalanche is great for turbo decks that play a lot of items like Malamar or Rayquaza, and Weavile can punish decks who put a bunch of vulnerable Pokemon with abilities on their bench. All of these Pokemon can attack with a single energy, which is great because you also have no energy acceleration or search. You also lack a consistent draw engine outside of Lillie and pray, which Magcargo and Oranguru hope to help. The snail and monkey can give you some clutch cards sometimes, but when you brick with this deck, you tend to brick HARD.</p>
<p>This deck tends to do very well against aggressive GX strategies or slower setup decks. It trades extremely favorably into most Basic GX Pokemon, and a boosted Sledgehammer or Trashalanche can chase down evolving basics. It really struggles; however, against other single-prizers that can dish out damage more consistently like Granbull or Baby Buzzwole in other decks. This deck only plays special energy, so if you are unable to run control or Zoroark off the board before they set up, Enhanced Hammer loops can be extremely dangerous. While this deck is extremely agressive, you often need to rely on your opponent to do large amounts of damage. Buzzwole is capped at 30 damage with modifiers that push it to 80 on non-GX Pokemon in the early game. If your opponents waits until they are able to handle a full power sledgehammer before going down to 4 prizes, you often aren&rsquo;t able to recover. Since Weavile and Garbodor need your opponent to play down Pokemon with abilities or play item cards to do damage, smart opponents will try to limit these before you are able to punish them.</p>

<p>This deck really thrived when Strong Energy was legal, but it still packs quite a punch in this format. Buzzwole GX is one of the fastest attackers in the game, being able to do 30 to the active and 30 to the bench with Jet Punch for only a single energy. Beast Energy, Diancie Prism Star, and Choice Band can quickly boost this damage. Buzzwole is the main attacker, and Lycanroc is great for gusting without using your supportor. Its Dangerous Rogue GX attack is one of the strongest attacks in the game, and is super efficient for only 2 energy. Ninetales is not standard in Buzzroc, but serves a couple purposes here. First, it allows you to take advantage of your limited Beast Ring turns by searching out two item cards on evolution. Beast Ring is super important in allowing this deck to take big knockouts in the mid-game, so being able to find it on demand is great. The second main reason is for psychic decks. Buzzwole is weak to psychic and gives up 2 prizes, so Malamar becomes a super difficult matchup. Ninetales and multi-switch allow you to attack Inkay and Malamar early without putting a massive 2 prize liability in the early game. Alolan Vulpix&rsquo;s Beacon attack is also amazing for searching Pokemon in the early game, so it never hurts to have that. Girafarig can also help against malamar by lost zoning their psychic energy before they can accelerate it.</p>
<p>This deck hopes to come out of the gate swinging, and keep up the pressure in the mid-game with Beast Ring. This allows it to bully evolving decks and trade blows with other big basic GX decks. It has a really hard time with any single prize deck that can up-trade into it without being pressured by Jet Punch. White Kyurem and Granbull are this deck&rsquo;s kryptonite. Any deck that plays psychic attackers is also quite a difficult matchup, as your only good energy acceleration is through Beast Ring which can only accelerate to Buzzwole. Lycanroc and Ninetales help in the psychic mathups, but in no way make it favorable.</p>

<p>This is not one of my favorite decks in format, but it is fun to play. The main goal is to set up a Magnezone which can accelerate as much energy from your hand as your like to one of your attackers. Dusk Mane Necrozma GX is great for dealing with big Pokemon GX with Meteor Tempest, and Dialga can deal with evolving Pokemon with Turn Back Time or other single prizers with Power Blast. Once you get set up, Mount Coronet lets you continually stream metal energy and launch powerful attacks each turn. The stop-gap, however is in setting up. You need to have both rare candy and Magnezone in hand to evolve it, so Cynthia is a long shot to draw into the combo. Steven&rsquo;s Resolve lets you get directly there, but ends your turn which is not great at all. Your opponent also knows you have three good cards in hand, so a Judge or Marshadow is very tempting. Even if you set up Magnezone, you still need to have the energy to accelerate in hand. Lady lets you search 4 out of deck, but takes your supporter for turn which you usually would rather have spent on Cynthia or Guzma. The deck is inconsistent, but has a great matchup spread taking on both big GX Pokemon and single prize decks with ease. It is also great against energy denial strategies since Coronet and Magnezone let you recycle energy as long as you want.s</p>

  </p>
<p>This is an interesting single prize deck that can do a lot of damage for not a lot of energy. Empoleon is your main attacker with its Total Command doing up to 200 damage for two energy. The only issue is that Empoleon is a stage 2 pokemon that can require multiple energy attachments. Counter energy helps with the energy, as it provide 2 of any color when you are down on prizes. A super thick Empoleon line lets you set up slowly, and Swampert helps you draw through your deck to get key combo cards. Alolan Ninetales GX lets you search for Rare Candy and Timer Balls to quickly evolve your Birds, but is a 2 prize liability in an otherwise single prize deck, so it should be used carefully. In the Sun &amp; Moon era, Pokemon began doing this weird thing where they print the exact same card in different types, and Empoleon is the recipient of one of these weird splits. It has both a water and metal type card, so you can use either depending on Weakness and Resistence of the deck you are facing. Be careful though, since there are no basic metal energy, so you may have a hard time finding energy for the metal Empoleon! (I may be speaking from experience&hellip;) Oranguru is in the deck to help recycle Empoleon pieces since Rare Candy are so integral to the strategy, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll need more than 4 in a game.</p>
<p>Like other Rare Candy decks with no draw engine, this deck sometimes has a hard time finding the pieces it needs when you need them. Once it sets up, it has little issue running through most meta decks, but setting up can sometimes be a little dodgy. Alolan Ninetales helps this consistency, but putting a 2 prizer in play in an already slow deck is not great for the prize trade. Opponents also have some agency in your damage output as Total Command is limited by both players bench size, so if your opponent waits to bench Pokemon you could be limited to 120 or even 100 damage which rarely cuts it against evolving Pokemon GX.</p>

<p>This is a homebrew deck from the dark recesses of my mind. I was looking through GLC cards and found this Garchomp and Lucario and wondered if there were any recorded decks based around it. To my surprise, there weren&rsquo;t. So I built my own. In building it, I found why no one else had: it&rsquo;s <strong>bad</strong>. Doing 200 on a single prizer is great, with quick search on a stage 1 is even better. The issue is that you need Garchomp in play in order to use Lucario, and often you want to use Lucario to get Garchomp in play, making Lucario useless when setting up. The other issue is that if you are using Cynthia to get your 200 damage, you can&rsquo;t Guzma. I&rsquo;ve tried to build this as a sort of spread deck with Tapu Koko and Alolan Ninetales, but in practice it&rsquo;s just a bad Empoleon with a worse draw engine. It&rsquo;s fun if you hate Zoroark decks, but has major issues against literally anything else.</p>

<p>This deck won Roanoke Regionals with its unique blend of defense, utility, and power. Gardevoir GX is both your heavy hitter and energy acceleration. Secret Spring lets you attach an extra Fairy energy for each Gardevoir in play, adn Infinite Force will scale an extra 30 damage for each energy on both active Pokemon, giving you the ability for explosive attacks. Double colorless energy synegizes well with this, as secret spring can accelerate the Fairy to pay for the attack&rsquo;s cost, and then DCE can be attached from hand for a 90 damage swing. Twilight GX is also an insanely strong GX attack. Being able to shuffle TEN cards from the discard into your deck is ridiculous, especially for only one energy. You can get back DCE, Max Potion, Guzma, Rare Candy, whatever you can think of! Alolan Ninetales GX helps to set up your stage 2s and can also serve as an attacker in a pinch. Swampert is a great draw engine, and helps enable Super Boost Energy, which can add a whopping 120 damage to Infinite Force. Solgaleo is there to hit opposing Alolan Ninetales for weakness and accelerate extra energy against control or in slow matchups. Its ability is situational, but removing weakness is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>Gardevoir is super tanky, so it has no issue dealing with 2-hit KO decks like Zoroark, but decks that can KO it in one attack can prove hard to deal with. You spend a lot of resources setting up a Gardevoir, so losing it in one turn can be devastating. This deck also relatively slow compare to other evolving decks, so sometimes it can be blown our of the water by aggressive decks or even faster evolving decks. It has a very high skill ceiling, making it a great deck if you want to play SUM-LOT super competively without playing control.</p>

<p>This single prize deck took LAIC by storm, taking 2 of the top 8 placements. Granbull&rsquo;s All-Out attack does a massive 160 damage for one energy, but there&rsquo;s a catch: you need to have no cards in hand to do the boosted damage. This seems like an enormous cost, you may be completely out of luck if you don&rsquo;t top deck anything the next turn! However, a super thick line of Oranguru to draw up to 3 cards in hand and Magcargo to control your draws can give you the control you need to continually stream Granbull attacks without missing a beat. Apricorn Maker is the main engine of this deck, especially since Ultra Ball is legitimately the best card in deck. Ball cards can be played to lower your hand size by 1, but Ultra Ball lets you go down a whopping 3 cards, which is coincidentally how much you fraw up to from Oranguru. Supporters are very hard to deal with in this deck, since if you have more than one in your hand you&rsquo;ll need to find a way to discard the one you can&rsquo;t use. Ultra Balls are great for this, but since you can only run 4 (legally), this list runs a Mysterious Treasure to help with discards even though there isn&rsquo;t a valid target in the deck. Diantha is great since your Grabulls are often being knocked out, and it can let you recover important items like Ultra Ball or Choice Band to keep up your low hand size. This deck plays no GX Pokemon, so Shrine of Punishment is a free 10 damage boost on opposing GXs.</p>
<p>Doing upwards of 160 damage on a stage 1 single prizer for 1 basic energy seems too good to be true, but in this deck it not only happens, but does so extremely consistently. Since it up-trades very well, Granbull is able to miss the full power All-Out for a few turns and still win matchups. It tends to struggle against hard hand disruption, but in the opposite way most decks do! Most decks hate having only 4 cards to work with, but Granbull hates having 4 cards that they may not be able to play down. It can also struggle against single prizers that can trade KOs with it, but Body-Building Dumbbells is a nice tech for those matchups. This deck is extremely difficult to play well, but when you do it can beat almost anything in the metagame.</p>

<p>This deck was expected to be a meta-defining deck on release, and never quite lived up to the hype. The goal is to stack Pokemon in the Lost Zone with Skiploom&rsquo;s Floral Path to the Sky and Trumbeak&rsquo;s Mountain Pass to quickly boost the 20x multiplier of Natu and Jumpluff&rsquo;s Lost March to swing for big damage with single prizers. Trumbeak has no basic in this deck, so it is only used for its ability to send itself directly into the Lost Zone. Jumpluff is a stage 2, but acts as a stage 1 since Skiploom lets you put it down from your deck on the turn you play it. Natu needs less setup, but attacks for a DCE which is not as easily searchable as basic Grass and Net Ball. Lost Blender lets you add unneeded Pokemon to the lost zone and also draw a card, which pairs nicely with Magcargo&rsquo;s Smooth over. It is one of the few decks that plays a heavy Marshadow count with hopes of disrupting your opponent before they can deal with your onslaught.</p>
<p>Your main attackers have 70 and 40 HP, so spread decks are super hard to beat. Just 2 Feather Arrows from Decidueye GX can KO a Natu or Hoppip without even attacking. Though it seems it trades well into big GX Pokemon, Lost March takes a lot of resources to set up, so it often will fizzle out before taking the last few prizes. It also only plays 7 energy cards, so heavy energy disruption is diffult to beat unless you can win before they discard your energy. Lost March is a super aggressive deck that can hit absurd numbers and very fun to play, but is inconsistent and has a hard time setting up against faster decks.</p>

  </p>
<p>With Malamar&rsquo;s Psychic Recharge mimicking Dynamotor or Firestarter in older decks, psychic attackers have a fast and efficient way to power them up in SUM-LOT. Some lists rely on Ultra Necrozma GX and metal energy, but this one is more of a box-type deck. A thick 4-4 Malamar line helps to power up a variety of attackers, but mainly Necrozma for GX matchups and Giratina for single prizers. Necrozma GX lets you discard all Pychic energy from it to do 10 plus 60 damage for each energy attached, meaning you can do a massive 250 damage for 4 energy attached, which you can then reuse with Psychic Recharge. Chimecho is an interesting tech that can slow down evolving decks with its first attack. Dawn Wings Necrozma works similarly to Keldeo EX and lets you switch it into the active to Psychic Recharge to the bench. Marshadow helps the Zoroark matchup by letting you hit for weakness by copying an attack in the discard.</p>
<p>The harded part of this deck is getting Psychic energy in the discard to accelerate. Mysterious Treasure helps, but with no way to search basic energy, you need to raw draw into them. Psychic recharge also only accelerates to benched Pokemon, so sometimes you don&rsquo;t have the necessary switch to get it into the active. 4 switch and 4 Guzma help, but with no onboard draw engine, you often have to hope you draw into what you need. Necrozma hits super big numbers, but Zoroark is still a difficult matchup since they can chase down your Malamar leaving you stranded. Consistency in general is an issue with Malamar, but its power is simply too much for certain decks handles.</p>

<p>One of my favorite decks in the format (it&rsquo;s just because I like the yellow and green energy), this is one of the few agressive big-basic 2 prizers in format. Rayquaza GX can accerlate to itself with its Stormy Winds ability, and Vikavolt&rsquo;s Strong charge can power up Dragon Gale for huge damage out of nowhere. Tempest GX is also an amazing attack for setting up, discard your hand and drawing 10 is a huge boost to consistency. Zeraora GX is great for mobility, giving free retreat to any Pokemon with Lightning energy attached. Dhelmise seems like an interesting inclusion, but it allows you to have a single prize board state since Vikavolt&rsquo;s attack is not very efficient.</p>
<p>Speaking of consistency, this deck misses it at times. Stormy Winds mills the top 3 cards of your deck, so you will often mill important resources which you can&rsquo;t recover. Vikavolt also needs Rare Candy to set up, which like other decks on this list is very hard to achieve with Cynthia alone. Volkner really helps in this regard, but you still have to have one of the pieces in hand to use it to set up Vikavolt.</p>
