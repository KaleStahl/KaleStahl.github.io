<p>The Sun and Moon era of the Pokemon TCG is looked back on extremely fondly by competitively players, and rightly so. After the dominance of big-basic strategies in the Black and White era, and them continuing into XY due to the lackluster Mega Evolution mechanic, it was exciting to see the evolving Pokemon GX take over the reigns. With the introduction of the first few Sun and Moon sets, many of the less than desirable attributes of the XY era persisted: an over reliance on &ldquo;turbo&rdquo; item cards, basic pokemon dominating the format, and supporters that were extremely powerful with no negative impact on deck consistency. Almost every deck ran 4 Trainers&rsquo; mail, VS Seeker and Puzzle of Time, with hopes of setting up faster than their opponent. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough, the format included Professor Sycamore for draw support, N for late game disruption and even more early draw support, and Lysandre for unconditional gusting, all with unparalleled ease of access with VS seeker.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src = "/Sun-Moon-Promo-Art.png" width="1000" class="center" />
  </p>
<p>The 2017 and 2018 seasons went on with most of these cards legal, but the new, slower game-design brought on with Pokemon GX was beginning to shine through. It wasn&rsquo;t until all of the XY cards rotated out, do I think the format really got REALLY good. Unfortunately, this format only lasted until Team Up, when Pokemon decided to go back on everything that made Sun and Moon good and introduce insanely powerful basic 3-prize Tag Teams which took the format right back into the grips of turbo big basics. For this short time in 2018, from Sun and Moon base to Lost Thunder, we had one of the most fun and least toxic formats the TCG has seen in its modern era.</p>
<h1 id="an-introduction-to-sum-lot">An Introduction to SUM-LOT</h1>
<p>When I say that this format is not &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; I mean the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: There is no Tier 0 Deck</li>
<li>2: There are multiple Tier 1 Decks</li>
<li>3: Few decks lose to a single card tech inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Avid SUM-LOT players may conclude that point 1 is false in this format. They would be mostly correct, but I argue it won&rsquo;t matter if you are playing casually. For the most part, this format has many decks that are fun, consistent, and have a decent matchup spread, making it a great format to build some decks and play with your friends. At the time I built these decks (Summer 2023) they were quite affordable (~$40 a deck) to get everything in the correct printing and in decent condition, making SUM-LOT an even better choice for players just starting their venture into retro formats.</p>
<h2 id="important-cards">Important Cards</h2>
<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll detail some of the most important and influential cards that appear in SUM-LOT. This format is extremely diverse, so these are just the heavy hitters. I encourage you to look at other resources and see what other cards could be good in any deck you&rsquo;re building! Just because someone else didn&rsquo;t play it doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t make the deck better. Even though their time in the spotlight is over, retro formats are constantly evolving and SUM-LOT is no different.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="supporters">Supporters</h3>
<div>
<p>
Unlike modern formats, supporters were still able to be played on the first turn for the player going first. This allows for many more setup options for both players. Lysandre, N, and Professor Sycamore just rotated, so players were scrambling to find supporters to fill the void these three powerhouses left. 
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/guzma.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Guzma - BUS" 
style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
Fortunately, (or unfortunately for some), Burning Shadows replaced the unconditional gust of Lysandre with another gusting effect, Guzma. Guzma allows you to gust an opponent&rsquo;s benched Pokemon, and if you do, you must switch your own active Pokemon to the bench.This may be an even better effect than Lysandre, one of the best cards ever. Not only is gusting absolutely vital to the Pokemon TCG to ensure win conditions and punish opponents for benching vulnerable support Pokemon, but also serving as a switch card gives Guzma even more utility than Lysandre. Did you start your 3 retreat tech attacker? No problem! Just Guzma up a weak benched Pokemon and both take a prize card and get a liability out of the active! Guzma allows for extra creativity in deck building, as it can surve multiple purposes, allowing players to cut switch cards for more consistency.
<br></p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/lillie.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Lillie - SUMO" 
style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
When Guzma released, it almost universally replaced Lysandre. This was not the case for the draw supporters Lillie and Professor Sycamore. Though Lillie was released many sets after Professor Sycamore, it didn&rsquo;t see any play until we lost our Kalosian professor. Lillie allows you to draw cards until you have 6 in hand, which by itself is a fine effect seen on cards like Bianca before. However, it is the second line of text that really lets Lillie shine. If it is a players first turn, that player can draw cards until they have 8 in hand! Thats a lot of cards, especially for the first turn. Since Lillie spikes in usefulness on the first turn, many decks either play it as a 1-of to search with Tapu Lele GX or 4-of to maximize the chances of getting it in your opening hand. Either way, Lillie serves as an explosive early setup card, and a decent draw card in the mid to late game.
<br></p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/cynthia.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Cynthia - UPR" 
style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
Lillie relies on being able to play your hand down in order to draw cards, but what if your deck has a lot of evolutions or supporters and some hands become impossible to play down enough for Lillie to be effective? Enter Cynthia, the quintessential draw supporter. Shuffle draw 6 is pretty good, and being able to play Cynthia to see more cards without playing your hand down can be vital for slower setup decks that don&rsquo;t play many items or basic pokemon they can easily pitch from their hand.
<br></p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/elm.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Professor Elm's Lecture - LOT" 
style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
Cynthia and Lillie are good for seeing more cards, but sometimes you know exactly what you want and don&rsquo;t want to deal with whatever faff they may draw. This is where Professor Elm&rsquo;s lecture sees play. Decks that play a lot of basic GX&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t able to utilize it well, but evolving decks love the ability to search out 3 of their evolving basics. Elm also allows for some interesting choices to be made in deckbuilding. Would you like to use the 60 HP version of basic pokemon to search them with Elm, or would you prefer the 70 HP version that may have better attacks? This interplay is what makes Elm an interesting card in this format, as not all decks use it, but that ones that do REALLY depend on it to find their little guys.
<br></p>
<p>There are more niche supporters that see quite a bit of play, such as Professor Kukui to boost damage by 20, Acerola to pick up and heal damaged Pokemon, or Apricorn Maker for decks that play a lot of Poke Ball cards. These are the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; ones, but as I said before, don&rsquo;t be afraid to try out of the box supporters! Especially with Tapu Lele GX, one-of supporters can be found very easily and can help shift the tide of the battle in your favor!</p>

<h3 id="item-cards">Item Cards</h3>
<div>
Unlike other formats, items are not at the forefront of SUM-LOT, which in my opinion is good! Fewer must-play items generally allows for a slower, more methodical pace to games. In my time playing this format, rarely am I playing more than two or three item cards a turn and my entire setup isn't stunted if I miss a few key combos turn one (*cough* worlds 2016 *cough*). 
<p>That being said, ball search is still at a premium. We have the likes of ultra ball, nest ball, and great ball in format for general Pokemon search. Most decks will play some combination of these three, but there are a few more niche ball search options if your deck calls for it. Timer ball allows for evolution decks to find evolutions without the hefty cost of discarding 2 cards from their hand, although for the slightly more annoying downside of being reliant on coin flips. Mysterious Treasure is an amazing universal search card for decks that play many dragon or psychic Pokemon.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/ultra.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Ultra Ball- SUMO" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/nest.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Nest Ball - SUMO" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/great.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Great Ball - SUMO" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/rescue-stretcher.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Rescue Stretcher - GRI" 
style="float: right;margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;"/>
<p>Not every format has decent Pokemon recovery. Usually, there is some rod-type item that shuffles Pokemon or energy from the discard to the deck, or some card that takes a pokemon directly from the discard to the hand. SUM-LOT is amazing, because it has a card that can do both! Rescue stretcher can either shuffle three Pokemon from the discard back into the deck, or take any one and return it directly to your hand. This card is (as of now) the most powerful item-based recovery card in history. The option to either shuffle multiple Pokemon or immediately get one back lends itself to be helpful in almost any situations, and allows for further role compression like Guzma mentioned before.</p>
</p>
Pokemon Tools are a vital part of any metagame, and while this remains true for SUM-LOT, it tends to lack the options seen in other formats. Choice band is essential for any deck that needs to buff its numbers on Pokemon GX, and counter gain is useful for decks that both like to fall behind and have attacks with colorless energy to use it. Aside from that, there are just a few other niche tools that a couple decks might want to use.
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/choice-band.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Choice Band - GRI"
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/counter-gain.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Counter Gain - BUS" 
    style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
    <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/field-blower.png" 
      width="200" class="center" 
      alt = "Field Blower - GRI" 
      style ="float: center; margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px;"/>
</p>
Despite not having a variety of tools and as we'll later see, stadiums, Guardians Rising gave us Field Blower. This simple leaf blower is a super buffed tool scrapper that can now discard stadiums. Since stadiums and tools aren't as absolutely necessary as older format, this card finds itself as a one-of in most decks rather than a four-of when we had Garbotoxin. Even though its population has dwindled, when used at the right time its power is still undeniable.

<h3 id="stadiums">Stadiums</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/brooklet-hill.png" 
    width="200" class="center" 
    alt = "Brooklet Hill - GRI" 
    style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"/>
    As I said previously, stadiums are more of a niche inclusion in this format, but there are still two big ones that I feel are worth mentioning. Brooklet Hill is an absolutely insane stadium, allowing either player to search their deck for any water or fighting Pokemon, with or without a rule box. With fighting and water Pokemon such as baby Buzzwole, Lycanroc GX, and Alolan Vulpix being as splashable as they are, Brooklet hill becomes an easy inclusion in many decks. Even if you don't play it in your deck, often you can steal your opponent's Brooklet hill!
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/shrine-punish.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Shrine of Punishment - CES" 
style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" />
The only &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; stadium in this format is played by single prize decks to help fix math on GX-heavy decks. Shrine of Punishment puts 1 damage counter on all GX Pokemon in-between turns, which can really stack up! Decks like White-Kyurem and Granbull will play heavy counts of Shrine to punish the general lack of Field Blower and other counter stadiums. Occasionally you will see other archetype specific stadiums such as Devoured Field in Zoroark GX or Temple of the Moone in Malamar decks, but Shrine and Brooklet hill and the most popular and something you should always be on the lookout for.</p>

<h3 id="pokemon">Pokemon</h3>
<div>
Trainers are fun, but Pokemon are (literally) the name of the game. Pokemon GX are Sun and Moon's new mechanic, and boy are they good. They give up two prizes when knocked out like Pokemon EX before them, but as I mentioned previously, they follow the normal evolution rules. Rowlet evolves into Dartrix, which then can evolve into Decidueye GX. This small change is massive since the evolving Pokemon are so much stronger than their basic counterparts, so-called "big basic" strategies are phased out in favor of evolving Pokemon GX. The GX mechanic also tries to parallel the video games' Z-moves with each Pokemon GX having a special GX attack. These moves are extremely powerful, and once you use one you must flip a marker and are unable to use a GX attack for the rest of the game. These once-per game attacks, while not game breaking, are an interesting change of pace and allow for long term decision making not only on when to use your GX attack, but which one to use since all Pokemon GX possess one.
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/zoroark-gx.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Zoroark GX - SHF" 
style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"/>
If you ask any competitive player who played between 2017 and 2019 what they think is the strongest card ever printed, most if not all would say Zoroark GX. This card has everything, an amazing draw ability, an efficient attack, colorless energy cost, and a massive 210 HP. Zoroark is so versatile, it can be paired with almost anything. Since it provides a low to the ground draw engine and can fulfill its entire attack cost for only a Double Colorless Energy, it is a welcome addition to any evolving decks that need an engine and plays DCE. Common partners include (but are not limited to!): Lycanroc GX, Glaceon GX, Oranguru, Ninetales GX, Decidueye GX, Gyarados, Weavile, or even itself! Pure Zoroark decks are just as viable as partnering it with another attacker.</p>
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/oranguru-up.png" 
width="200" 
class="center" 
alt = "Oranguru - UPR" 
style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" />
The most egregious partner for Zoroark GX might be Oranguru from Ultra Prism. Remember when I said there is a tier zero deck in this format? It&rsquo;s control, and Oranguru is a massive contrbutor to that. Oranguru allows you to return any three cards from your discard to the bottom of your deck. Paired with Zoroark, you can easily draw through you deck each turn and recover disruption items such as Crushing and Enhanced Hammer, Counter Catcher, and Max Potion to run your opponent out of resources. This gives you a near infinite loop and even some non-control decks will run Oranguru to help recycle importamt resources like Double Colorless Energy or Rare Candy. This is one of the most powerful attacks in the history of the game, and it being banned from Expanded and Gym Leader Challenge should show its ability to create toxic games. I will talk more about control in the next section, but do not worry! Even though I said Oranguru can be toxic, I think there are ways to mitigate it when playing this format for fun.</p>
<p><img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/tapu-lele-gx.png" 
width="200" class="center" 
alt = "Tapu Lele GX - GRI" 
style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px;"/>
Zoroark GX is able to give decks a solid draw engine on a stage 1, but what if you don&rsquo;t have time for all this evolving nonsense? Tapu Lele GX may be the card for your deck! Wonder Tag lets you search any supporter when you bench Tapu Lele, meaning an Ultra Ball or Mysterious Treasure can become any supporter you want. Not only in Tapu Lele an excellent support Pokemon, it is rarely a liability once you bench it. With only one retreat and 170 HP, it is difficult for your opponent to use Guzma to either knock it out or trap it in the active. Energy drive is also a great attack, dealing 20 damage for every energy attached to both active for only a Double Colorless energy which allows Tapu Lele to attack in a pinch. Almost every deck plays at least one Tapu Lele GX, if not more as the consistency it provides is absolutely invaluable.</p>
<p><img
src = "/Pokemon_Cards/marshadow.png" 
width="200" 
class="center" 
alt = "Marshadow - SHF" 
style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" />
Unlike other formats with Marnie, N, Iono, or Rocket&rsquo;s Admin, the only real supporter based hand disruption present in SUM-LOT is Judge. For the record, Judge is absolutely not bad, it just is not usualy your first choice for your single supporter for turn. But what if judge was usable as an ability? Enter Marshadow&rsquo;s Let Loose. First seen on Giratina from Platinum, this ability essentials lets you play judge whenever you bench it from hand. Since it doesn&rsquo;t take your supporter slot, you can either Let Loose in hopes of finding a supporter, or use a supporter to find your Marshadow. Some think that the ability to play both a turn 1 supporter and Let Loose could be toxic; forcing your opponent to start with a 4 card hand before they even get to do anything. I am not of this camp. The abundant Pokemon and supproter search with Tapu Lele GX makes an early Let Loose not nearly as effective as late game once you know what resources your opponent has left. While some players may try to brick their opponent off an early Let Loose, I&rsquo;ve found that it rarely wins games outright, if doing anything at all.</p>
<p>These are a few of the cards you should definitely consider when building decks for this format &ndash; either playing them or finding ways to couter them. This format is quite wide and has many viable strategies, so just because Zoroark is good, doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone will play it!</p>
