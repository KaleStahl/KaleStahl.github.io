<p>The Sun and Moon era of the Pokemon TCG is looked back on extremely fondly by competitively players, and rightly so. After the dominance of big-basic strategies in the Black and White era, and them continuing into XY due to the lackluster Mega Evolution mechanic, it was exciting to see the evolving Pokemon GX take over the reigns. With the introduction of the first few Sun and Moon sets, many of the less than desirable attributes of the XY era persisted: an over reliance on &ldquo;turbo&rdquo; item cards, basic pokemon dominating the format, and supporters that were extremely powerful with no negative impact on deck consistency. Almost every deck ran 4 Trainers&rsquo; mail, VS Seeker and Puzzle of Time, with hopes of setting up faster than their opponent. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough, the format included Professor Sycamore for draw support, N for late game disruption and even more early draw support, and Lysandre for unconditional gusting, all with unparalleled ease of access with VS seeker.</p>

  </p>
<p>The 2017 and 2018 seasons went on with most of these cards legal, but the new, slower game-design brought on with Pokemon GX was beginning to shine through. It wasn&rsquo;t until all of the XY cards rotated out, do I think the format really got REALLY good. Unfortunately, this format only lasted until Team Up, when Pokemon decided to go back on everything that made Sun and Moon good and introduce insanely powerful basic 3-prize Tag Teams which took the format right back into the grips of turbo big basics. For this short time in 2018, from Sun and Moon base to Lost Thunder, we had one of the most fun and least toxic formats the TCG has seen in its modern era.</p>
<h1 id="an-introduction-to-sum-lot">An Introduction to SUM-LOT</h1>
<p>When I say that this format is not &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; I mean the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: There is no Tier 0 Deck</li>
<li>2: There are multiple Tier 1 Decks</li>
<li>3: Few decks lose to a single card tech inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Avid SUM-LOT players may conclude that point 1 is false in this format. They would be mostly correct, but I argue it won&rsquo;t matter if you are playing casually. For the most part, this format has many decks that are fun, consistent, and have a decent matchup spread, making it a great format to build some decks and play with your friends. At the time I built these decks (Summer 2023) they were quite affordable (~$40 a deck) to get everything in the correct printing and in decent condition, making SUM-LOT an even better choice for players just starting their venture into retro formats.</p>
<h2 id="important-cards">Important Cards</h2>
<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll detail some of the most important and influential cards that appear in SUM-LOT. This format is extremely diverse, so these are just the heavy hitters. I encourage you to look at other resources and see what other cards could be good in any deck you&rsquo;re building! Just because someone else didn&rsquo;t play it doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t make the deck better. Even though their time in the spotlight is over, retro formats are constantly evolving and SUM-LOT is no different.</p>
<h3 id="supporters">Supporters</h3>
<p>
Unlike modern formats, supporters were still able to be played on the first turn for the player going first. This allows for many more setup options for both players. Lysandre, N, and Professor Sycamore just rotated, so players were scrambling to find supporters to fill the void these three powerhouses left. 
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/guzma.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "guzma" style="float: right;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
<p>Fortunately, (or unfortunately for some), Burning Shadows replaced the unconditional gust of Lysandre with another gusting effect, Guzma. Guzma allows you to gust an opponent&rsquo;s benched Pokemon, and if you do, you must switch your own active Pokemon to the bench.This may be an even better effect than Lysandre, one of the best cards ever. Not only is gusting absolutely vital to the Pokemon TCG to ensure win conditions and punish opponents for benching vulnerable support Pokemon, but also serving as a switch card gives Guzma even more utility than Lysandre. Did you start your 3 retreat tech attacker? No problem! Just Guzma up a weak benched Pokemon and both take a prize card and get a liability out of the active! Guzma allows for extra creativity in deck building, as it can surve multiple purposes, allowing players to cut switch cards for more consistency.</p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/lillie.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "lillie" style="float: left;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
<p>When Guzma released, it almost universally replaced Lysandre. This was not the case for the draw supporters Lillie and Professor Sycamore. Though Lillie was released many sets after Professor Sycamore, it didn&rsquo;t see any play until we lost our Kalosian professor. Lillie allows you to draw cards until you have 6 in hand, which by itself is a fine effect seen on cards like Bianca before. However, it is the second line of text that really lets Lillie shine. If it is a players first turn, that player can draw cards until they have 8 in hand! Thats a lot of cards, especially for the first turn. Since Lillie spikes in usefulness on the first turn, many decks either play it as a 1-of to search with Tapu Lele GX or 4-of to maximize the chances of getting it in your opening hand. Either way, Lillie serves as an explosive early setup card, and a decent draw card in the mid to late game.</p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/cynthia.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "cynthia" style="float: right;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
<p>Lillie relies on being able to play your hand down in order to draw cards, but what if your deck has a lot of evolutions or supporters and some hands become impossible to play down enough for Lillie to be effective? Enter Cynthia, the quintessential draw supporter. Shuffle draw 6 is pretty good, and being able to play Cynthia to see more cards without playing your hand down can be vital for slower setup decks that don&rsquo;t play many items or basic pokemon they can easily pitch from their hand.</p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/elm.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "professor elm's lecture" style="float: left;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
<p>Cynthia and Lillie are good for seeing more cards, but sometimes you know exactly what you want and don&rsquo;t want to deal with whatever faff they may draw. This is where Professor Elm&rsquo;s lecture sees play. Decks that play a lot of basic GX&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t able to utilize it well, but evolving decks love the ability to search out 3 of their evolving basics. Elm also allows for some interesting choices to be made in deckbuilding. Would you like to use the 60 HP version of basic pokemon to search them with Elm, or would you prefer the 70 HP version that may have better attacks? This interplay is what makes Elm an interesting card in this format, as not all decks use it, but that ones that do REALLY depend on it to find their little guys.</p>
</p>
There are more niche supporters that see quite a bit of play, such as Professor Kukui to boost damage by 20, Acerola to pick up and heal damaged Pokemon, or Apricorn Maker for decks that play a lot of Poke Ball cards. These are the "standard" ones, but as I said before, don't be afraid to try out of the box supporters! Especially with Tapu Lele GX, one-of supporters can be found very easily and can help shift the tide of the battle in your favor!

  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/acerola.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "acerola" style="float: center;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/apricorn.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "apricorn maker" style="float: center;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
</p>
<h3 id="item-cards">Item Cards</h3>
<p>Unlike other formats, items are not at the forefront of SUM-LOT, which in my opinion is good! Fewer must-play items generally allows for a slower, more methodical pace to games. In my time playing this format, rarely am I playing more than two or three item cards a turn and my entire setup isn&rsquo;t stunted if I miss a few key combos turn one (*cough* worlds 2016 *cough*).</p>
<p>That being said, ball search is still at a premium. We have the likes of ultra ball, nest ball, and great ball in format for general Pokemon search. Most decks will play some combination of these three, but there are a few more niche ball search options if your deck calls for it. Timer ball allows for evolution decks to find evolutions without the hefty cost of discarding 2 cards from their hand, although for the slightly more annoying downside of being reliant on coin flips. Mysterious Treasure is an amazing universal search card for decks that play many dragon or psychic Pokemon.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/ultra.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "ultra ball" />
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/nest.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "nest ball" />
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/great.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "great ball" />
</p>
<p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/rescue-stretcher.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "rescue stretcher" style="float: right;margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px;"/>
<p>Not every format has decent Pokemon recovery. Usually, there is some rod-type item that shuffles Pokemon or energy from the discard to the deck, or some card that takes a pokemon directly from the discard to the hand. SUM-LOT is amazing, because it has a card that can do both! Rescue stretcher can either shuffle three Pokemon from the discard back into the deck, or take any one and return it directly to your hand. This card is (as of now) the most powerful item-based recovery card in history. The option to either shuffle multiple Pokemon or immediately get one back lends itself to be helpful in almost any situations, and allows for further role compression like Guzma mentioned before.</p>
</p>
Pokemon Tools are a vital part of any metagame, and while this remains true for SUM-LOT, it tends to lack the options seen in other formats. Choice band is essential for any deck that needs to buff its numbers on Pokemon GX, and counter gain is useful for decks that both like to fall behind and have attacks with colorless energy to use it. Aside from that, there are just a few other niche tools that a couple decks might want to use.
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/choice-band.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "ultra ball"/>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/counter-gain.png" width="150" class="center" alt = "nest ball" />
</p>
<p>
<img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/field-blower.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "field blower" style="float: left;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
Despite not having a variety of tools and as we'll later see, stadiums, Guardians Rising gave us Field Blower. This simple leaf blower is a super buffed tool scrapper that can now discard stadiums. Since stadiums and tools aren't as absolutely necessary as older format, this card finds itself as a one-of in most decks rather than a four-of when we had Garbotoxin. Even though its population has dwindled, when used at the right time its power is still undeniable.
</p>
<h3 id="stadiums">Stadiums</h3>
<p>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/brooklet-hill.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "rescue stretcher" style="float: right;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>
<p>As I said previously, stadiums are more of a niche inclusion in this format, but there are still two big ones that I feel are worth mentioning. Brooklet Hill is an absolutely insane stadium, allowing either player to search their deck for any water or fighting Pokemon, with or without a rule box. With fighting and water Pokemon such as baby Buzzwole, Lycanroc GX, and Alolan Vulpix being as splashable as they are, Brooklet hill becomes an easy inclusion in many decks. Even if you don&rsquo;t play it in your deck, often you can steal your opponent&rsquo;s Brooklet hill!</p>
  <img src = "/Pokemon_Cards/shrine-punish.png" width="200" class="center" alt = "rescue stretcher" style="float: left;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;" />
<p>The only &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; stadium in this format is played by single prize decks to help fix math on GX-heavy decks. Shrine of Punishment puts 1 damage counter on all GX Pokemon in-between turns, which can really stack up! Decks like White-Kyurem and Granbull will play heavy counts of Shrine to punish the general lack of Field Blower and other counter stadiums.</p>
