Overall Review Score: 4/7<br></p>
<p>This section may turn into a rant, but it&rsquo;s whatever. I was so incredibly excited for this game. I first played Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii with my friend in 3rd grade, and was immediately hooked. I&rsquo;ve played 200 hours of MH3U, at least 700 hours of MH4U, 600 hours of MHG+MHGU, and like 400 hours of MHRise. I adore Monster Hunter Stories and Stories 2, and even went back and bought a PSP to bang my head against a wall in Freedom Unite. It&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;m a pretty big fan of the Monster Hunter series.
Despite this, you might notice that I&rsquo;ve played almost all Monster Hunter releases except for Monster Hunter World and Iceborne. This is because I am a filthy casual who only owned a 3DS and a Switch at the time, and didn&rsquo;t think it was worth it to buy a nice PC or console to play World. (I was also like 17 and didn&rsquo;t have much disposable income to drop on such things)</p>
<p>This all changed with Monster Hunter Wilds. I had gotten my partner into Rise with me, so we were both excited to play a new game together. The Switch made it super easy for us to play together in the same house: one of us would play on the TV, the other in handheld mode. Wilds, however, was not releasing (nor should it ever release) on the Switch. My partner already had a decent PC, so she could play, but without my own setup I was out of luck.</p>
