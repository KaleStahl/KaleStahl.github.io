<p>This section may turn into a rant, but it&rsquo;s whatever. I was so incredibly excited for this game. I first played Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii with my friend in 3rd grade, and was immediately hooked. I&rsquo;ve played 200 hours of MH3U, at least 700 hours of MH4U, 600 hours of MHG+MHGU, and like 400 hours of MHRise. I adore Monster Hunter Stories and Stories 2, and even went back and bought a PSP to bang my head against a wall in Freedom Unite. It&rsquo;s safe to say I&rsquo;m a pretty big fan of the Monster Hunter series.
Despite this, you might notice that I&rsquo;ve played almost all Monster Hunter releases except for Monster Hunter World and Iceborne. This is because I am a filthy casual who only owned a 3DS and a Switch at the time, and didn&rsquo;t think it was worth it to buy a nice PC or console to play World. (I was also like 17 and didn&rsquo;t have much disposable income to drop on such things)</p>
<p>This all changed with Monster Hunter Wilds. I had gotten my partner into Rise with me, so we were both excited to play a new game together. The Switch made it super easy for us to play together in the same house: one of us would play on the TV, the other in handheld mode. Wilds, however, was not releasing (nor should it ever release) on the Switch. My partner already had a decent PC, so she could play, but without my own setup I was out of luck. So, I decided to shell out my limited funds and &ldquo;build&rdquo; a PC with the minimum specs recommended for Wilds. This was how bad I wanted to play this game.</p>
<p>Then the game released. After playing the demo, I was cautiously optimistic. The gameplay was as fun as ever, but the graphics were kind of bland and gray and the world didn&rsquo;t feel super interesting. Against Monster Hunter tradition (not by the World/Wilds team), the game began with a lengthy exposition and tutorial section that I was just trying to get through to play the fun stuff. But it simply felt like it never ended. I just wanted to make a lobby with my partner, and I had to play like an hour of boring nothingness to even get there! This wasn&rsquo;t a great start, but I still love Monster Hunter, and the combat gameplay is just as smooth and responsive as I had come to expect. Fighting monsters was cool and satisfying, which I cannot say about literally everything else. The Seikret is just an automatic monster finding. The maps are mazes so it is really annoying to track down a monster without just letting your lizard horse do it for you. The menus are also completely useless and organized in the weirdest way possible. Now, Monster Hunter is no stranger to menu clutter, but this feels even worse than usual. I don&rsquo;t think this is a bad game, but after playing I definitely prefer the older games and do not like the MMO-ization the World/Wilds team has been pushing lately.</p>

<p>Eh. It&rsquo;s an amazing game, but I have found myself returning to Double Dash or 8 Deluxe if I really want to play Mario Kart. The tracks are largely forgettable, and the &ldquo;returning&rdquo; tracks basically have no resemblence to the originals other than vague themes (Dino Dino Jungle is completely different other than there are dinosaurs present). The music is amazing, but since it is randomized I never remember a specific track song like I do with older tracks. Free roam is really fun, but there&rsquo;s not much to do for more than 5 minutes. Knockout Tour is amazing and the best part of the game, but it is unable to save the whole package for me. The really tried so hard to make the open interconnnected world work, that they managed to lose everything that made Mario Kart amazing. It&rsquo;s a great game, just not a great Mario Kart game.</p>

<p>I love Donkey Kong 64 despite all its (many) faults, and this game has made it so I will never return. It has all of the collectibles without the hassle, and the ability to destroy and manipulate terrain may be the single coolest thing I have ever witnessed. I will literally just sit there smashing the ground because everything in this game looks and feels so amazing. There isn&rsquo;t really anything else for me to say. Play this masterpiece of a monkey game.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say anything that hasn&rsquo;t already been said. This is game of the year, if not decade. Sure it&rsquo;s hard, but I have never enjoyed dying a bajillion times this much. Play it. You will not regret it.</p>
