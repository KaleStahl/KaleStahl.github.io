      <description>I am currently supported with funding as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.&#xA;My current research involves numerical methods for shape reconstruction in inverse scattering problems. In an inverse scattering problem, waves are scattered from an object, and the incident wave \(u^{in}\) and resulting wave \(u^{sc}\) are measured, with no a priori information about the scattering object. It is the goal of my work to use the information about the incident and scattered wave to determine characteristics about the unknown object.</description>

      <description>I am originally from Topeka, KS and am currently a senior finishing my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. I will be pursuing my Ph.D. in mathematics at Purdue University this fall. After my Ph.D., my ultimate goal is to be a professor at a university and teach and conduct research full time.&#xA;My current research interests and in applied math and PDE, and I am particularly fond of mathematical application to physics, especially within wave equations.</description>
