<p>Hi all! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Kale Stahl, and I am currently in my final year of my undergraduate studies in mathematics and physics at Kansas State University. My research interests are in inverse problems and applied analysis, especially within inverse scattering problems and scattering theory in general</p>
<p>At K-State I have worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dinhliemnguyen/home">Dr. Dinh-Liem Nguyen</a> and <a href="https://mupages.marshall.edu/sites/truongt/">Dr. Trung Truong</a> on multiple projects involving shape reconstruction in inverse scattering problems. I have worked previously with <a href="https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~yuliagh/">Dr. Yulia Hristova</a> and <a href="https://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~adityavv/">Dr. Aditya Viswanathan</a> in the 2022 University of Michigan-Dearborn REU For Analysis and Application on a project detecting edge signals from phaseless signal measurements.</p>
